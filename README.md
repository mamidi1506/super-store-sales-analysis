Analyzed pizza sales using SQL to extract key metrics like top-selling pizzas, revenue trends, and order patterns. Created interactive Power BI dashboards with KPIs and visualizations to provide actionable insights for business growth, inventory optimization, and strategic decision-making.
## Power BI Visualizations

I connected the pizza sales SQL database to Power BI and built an interactive dashboard that provides actionable business insights:

- **Top KPIs** such as total orders, total revenue, and average pizzas sold per day.
- **Bar charts** highlighting the top 5 pizzas by quantity ordered.
- **Stacked column charts** showing revenue contribution by pizza categories.
- **Heat maps** displaying order volume trends by hour of the day.
- **Line charts** tracking cumulative revenue growth over time.
- **Pie charts** illustrating the distribution of pizza sizes ordered.

These visuals help stakeholders quickly identify sales trends, popular products, and peak ordering times to drive data-informed decisions.
